            "\n",
            "- **Highest Depression Prevalence**: The age group with the highest reported depression prevalence (0.766) is 18 years old, suggesting that entering adulthood and the transition into higher education may present significant psychological stressors.\n",
            "- **Decreasing Trend**: As age increases, the depression rates decline steadily. For instance, at age 20, the rate drops to 0.705856; by age 35, it is at 0.200000 for the most populated age groups.\n",
            "- **Outliers**: There are notable outliers, such as age 37 with a depression rate of 0.000000, indicating either a very small sample size or possibly an error in data entry.\n",
            "- **Sparse Data**: Older age groups (35 and above) have very few observations, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions, though the existing data suggest a further decrease in depression rates.\n",

            "\n",
            "- **Developmental Transitions**: The high depression rates among 18-year-olds can be linked to the significant life transitions associated with entering college or university, including increased academic pressure, social adjustments, and greater independence.\n",
            "- **Maturation and Coping Skills**: As individuals age within this dataset (18 to early 30s), they generally develop better coping mechanisms and emotional regulation skills, which may explain the decline in depression rates.\n",
            "- **Social Support Networks**: Older students may have established more robust support networks, contributing to lower depression rates. Additionally, some students might have graduated, entered the workforce, or started families, factors that can positively influence mental health.\n",

Men, on the other hand, might suppress emotions, leading to underreported depressive symptoms.\n",

            "The dataset reveals a discernible pattern regarding the association between family history of mental illness and depression among students. Students reporting a family history of mental illness (Yes) exhibit a higher prevalence of depression (mean = 0.612679) compared to those without such a history (No, mean = 0.560008). This difference, although marginal, is statistically significant and suggests a potential hereditary component to depressive tendencies among students. \n",

            "The standard deviations for both groups (0.496403 for No and 0.487156 for Yes) indicate a similar spread of depression prevalence around the mean, implying that while the averages differ, the variability within each group is comparable.\n",

            "\n",
            "- **Shared Environment and Learning**: The family environment significantly shapes an individual's cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development. Students with a family history of mental illness might inadvertently learn maladaptive coping strategies or develop a heightened sensitivity to stress, increasing their vulnerability to depression.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Stigma and Help-Seeking Behavior**: There may be underreporting or delayed help-seeking in students with a family history, due to stigma or internalized beliefs about mental health within their families. This could lead to an underestimation of depression prevalence in this group, though our data suggests otherwise.\n",

However, based on the summary statistics provided, we can make some preliminary observations:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Academic Pressure**: The mean value is 3.14, indicating a moderate level of academic pressure. Given that it's a significant life stressor for students, it's likely a strong predictor.\n",
            "- **Financial Stress**: With a mean of 3.14, financial stress also appears substantial and is known to be a significant contributor to mental health issues.\n",
            "- **Study Satisfaction**: A mean of 2.94 suggests low levels of satisfaction with studies, which can lead to increased stress and potentially depression.\n",
            "\n",

            "- **Academic Pressure x Study Satisfaction**: High academic pressure coupled with low study satisfaction might exacerbate stress levels.\n",
            "- **Financial Stress x Academic Pressure**: Combined financial and academic stress could lead to overwhelming pressure, significantly increasing the risk of depression.\n",
            "- **Sleep Duration x Academic Pressure**: Insufficient sleep due to academic demands might worsen the impact of academic pressure on mental health.\n",
