            "- **Decline Trend**: A gradual decline in depression rates is observed from ages 24 to 34, with a noticeable drop to approximately 0.38 by age 35.\n",

            "- **Maturation and Resilience**: The decline in depression rates from ages 24 to 34 could indicate increased coping skills, emotional maturity, and social support networks as individuals gain life experience.\n",
            "- **Life Stages**: The sharp decline after age 35 might reflect the stabilization of life circumstances, such as career establishment and family formation, reducing stressors associated with early adulthood.\n",

            "\n",
            "To identify the three strongest predictors of depression, we can perform a multivariate regression analysis. However, given the summary statistics, we can make preliminary observations:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Academic Pressure**: With a mean of 3.14, academic pressure appears to be moderately high, suggesting it could be a significant predictor of depression.\n",
            "- **Financial Stress**: The mean financial stress score is 3.14, indicating a considerable level of stress, which is associated with depression.\n",
            "- **Study Satisfaction**: A mean score of 2.94 suggests moderate levels of dissatisfaction with studies, which may contribute to depressive feelings.\n",
            "\n",
            "These three factors stand out as potential strong predictors and should be further investigated using statistical models to confirm their predictive power.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 2. Interaction Effects Between Different Factors\n",
            "\n",
            "Interaction effects can be explored through additional statistical analyses, such as interaction terms in regression models or by visualizing relationships with interaction plots. From the summary, we can speculate on some potential interactions:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Academic Pressure & Study Satisfaction**: Higher academic pressure combined with lower study satisfaction might exacerbate depression.\n",
            "- **Financial Stress & Academic Pressure**: Combined financial stress and academic pressure could be particularly detrimental.\n",
            "- **Sleep Duration & Academic Pressure**: Insufficient sleep due to excessive study hours (implied by high 'Work/Study Hours') could amplify the impact of academic pressure on depression.\n",
            "\n",
            "These interactions should be tested statistically to confirm their significance.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 3. Recommended Priority Interventions\n",
            "\n",
            "Based on the identified predictors, priority interventions could include:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Academic Support Programs**: Implement programs to manage academic pressure, such as time management workshops, counseling services, and curriculum adjustments to reduce unnecessary workload.\n",
            "- **Financial Literacy and Support**: Offer financial counseling and resources to help students manage financial stress, possibly including scholarships or emergency funds.\n",
